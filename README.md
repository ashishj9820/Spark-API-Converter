# Spark-API-Converter
 
 DESCRIPTION:
-------------------------------------------
The PART 1 folder consists of the source code of the program "trial" folder, the "prog.jar" jar file and the "runn.bat" file to run the transformer and carry out the conversion from program written in RDD API to Dataset API. Apart from these there is another "Testcases" folder, which contains programs to test on the source code. The test cases and their output results are mentioned in the report.

The PART 2 folder consists of the source code of the program "trial2" folder, the "prog.jar" jar file and the "runn.bat" file to run the transformer and carry out the conversion from program written in RDD API to Dataframe API. Apart from these there is another "Testcases" folder, which contains programs to test on the source code. The test cases and their output results are mentioned in the report.

STEPS TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
-------------------------------------------
To execute the PART 1 of the project, go into the "PART 1" folder, go to the "INPUT" folder which contains the "inp.txt" file. RDD API program must be entered in this file ("inp.txt"). Please, do not change the filename ("inp.txt").

To execute the code-
For windows: When the "runn.bat" is run, output will be displayed on a new command prompt window
For Linux: On the terminal execute the jar file using the following command "java -jar prog.jar".

The output will also be stored in the "output.txt" file which is present in the "output" folder. 
Several testcases are already available in the same folder with a name "Testcases". 

3) To execute the PART 2 of the project, go into the "PART 2" folder, go to the "INPUT" folder which contains the "inp.txt" file. RDD API program must be entered in this file("inp.txt"). Please, do not change the filename ("inp.txt").

To execute the code-
For windows: When the "runn.bat" is run, output will be displayed on a new command prompt window
For Linux: On the terminal execute the jar file using the following command "java -jar prog.jar".

The output will also be stored in the "output.txt" file which is present in the "output" folder. 
Several testcases are already available in the same folder with a name "Testcases". 

Do not change the input file of the program "inp.txt" which is present in the "input" folder of PART 1 and PART 2. This is result in unsuccessful implementation of the tranformer.

No additional softwares are required to run any of the programs. The given files and folders are enough for the execution.
